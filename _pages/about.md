# About me
I am a Ph.D. student at the [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu) under the supervision of Professor [Jian-Xun Wang](http://sites.nd.edu/jianxun-wang/). As a researcher, I am passionate about exploring the intersection of deep learning and numerical simulation, with a focus on modeling and controlling complex physics systems, particularly in the realm of fluid mechanics.  

Besides research, I would call myself a "technophile". I am fancinated by the powerful mordern engineering accomplishments, especially computing hardwares. I set up and I am maintaining the GPU cluster of our lab (current 5 nodes, will gradually grow though).
