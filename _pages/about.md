I am a Ph.D. candidate at the [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu) under the supervision of Professor [Jian-Xun Wang](http://sites.nd.edu/jianxun-wang/). As a researcher, I am passionate about exploring the intersection of deep learning and partial differential equation ([PDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation)) simulation, with a focus of embedding human knowledge into deep neural networks. 

Besides research, I would call myself a tech nerd. I am always fancinated by the mordern engineering accomplishments, especially computing hardwares. I designed, configured and have been maintaining the multi-node GPU cluster - CoMSAIL for our lab at Notre Dame since 2021. 




# Education
